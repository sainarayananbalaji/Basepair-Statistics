#Base Chcker
## This code checks the percentage of GC and AT basepairs in a given genome sequence

* Input: FASTA file format
* NOTE: this is only compatible for one file run at a time. It is yet to be adapted to a multi- fasta file input.
* returns GC percentage, AT percentage, Shannon Entropy, Count of N (undetermined bases) and GC Skew
